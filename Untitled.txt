The new feature of text editor is to include auto save function. 
If you click the "Auto Save" under "Help" menu, the program will automatically save your file.
If you start a new file, the program will save as "Untilted.txt"
If you don't want to save automatically, you just deselect the same check box.
You will never lose your progress again.


I use multithreading in my auto save function, and create an inner class
I replace jbutton with icon image and tip text on my toolbar
I use a treemap collection to store my previous bookmark
